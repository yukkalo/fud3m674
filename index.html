    Reality is semi-real. 
    The boundaries of it's biological and digital body are similar to a surface of swamps - zones of geological instability, floating boundaries between land and water. 
    They are, at the same time, natural ecotones - sources of biodiversity and places of stress, where ecosystems collide and various ways of species coexistence meet.
    <br>We are considering various options for assembling new utopian scenarios of the world, the producers of which are algorithms and neural networks.
    The resulting reconstructions are hybrid patches, inhabited by a variety of myths and strange inhabitants - datasets involved in rehearsing the end of the world and visualizing its restoration. 
    While living organisms on Earth are gradually filling with plastic, a new (bio) diverse utopia is being written by machines.
